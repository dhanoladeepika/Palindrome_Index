# Palindrome_Index
A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same forwards as backward. This script provides a function to identify the index of a character that can be removed to make a non-palindromic string into a palindrome. It uses a combination of string comparison and palindrome checking to achieve this.
**Usage**
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Run the script using a Python interpreter.
Follow the prompts to input the string or multiple test cases.
The script will output the index of the character to remove or indicate that the string is already a palindrome.
